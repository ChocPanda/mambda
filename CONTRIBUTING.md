# Contributing

First things first, thank you for your contribution. It's easy to forget to say but I, the other contributors and all the users value the contributions made to the library; small or large all contributions are valued and welcome.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [github issues](https://github.com/ChocPanda/mambda/issues), maybe someone has the same idea as you and just up-voting would be a contribution towards prioritisation. You may also find the work has already begun and you can help by teaming up with another contributor.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
